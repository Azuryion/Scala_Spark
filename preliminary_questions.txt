Constraints : 
-    Prevent loosing Data. All data need to be analysed afterward.
-    99% of the data can be processed slowly and 1% MUST be processed quickly.
-    Scalable storage, easily extendable.

So what kind of component(s) (listed in the lecture) will the architecture need?

Components:
-    No-SQL / Distributed storage with « partition tolerance »
-    Key/Document database for data compression

2)

Constraints :
-    Detect agitated citizens and trigger alert as quickly as possible.

Components :
-    Using Stream to accelerate the detection phase.

3) 

No data-engineer : the previous team was composed of data scientists
but they are not trained to set up a big data architecture, 
a data scientist being trained in big data processing and analysis.

Which words were told by whom : This can be an interesting data to determine,
for example, which words cause a disturbance of the peace and therefore which
ones should be banned from common use.
